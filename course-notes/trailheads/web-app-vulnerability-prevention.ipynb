    "- XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Recent Attacks\n",
    "- [Check Point Security](https://research.checkpoint.com/parsedroid-targeting-android-development-research-community/) discovered almost all Android development tools (containing [APKTool](https://www.cyberscoop.com/android-developer-apps-vulnerabilities-check-point/)) contained a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it Works\n",
    "The XML 1.0 standard includes an entity concept--essentially a storage unit. External entities can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier, usually a URI, that can be dereferenced by the XML processor. The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences it, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since XXE attacks occur via the XML processing application, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems. The attack could disclose internal content via http(s) requests or launch a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to client-side memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability if too many threads or processes are not released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the application does not need to explicitly return the response to the attacker for it to be vulnerable to information disclosures. An attacker can leverage DNS information to exfiltrate data through subdomain names to a DNS server that he or she controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your system is vulnerable if\n",
    "- An application parses XML documents.\n",
    "- Untrusted data is allowed within the system identifier portion of the entity, within the document type definition (DTD).\n",
    "- An XML processor is configured to validate and process the DTD.\n",
    "- An XML processor is configured to resolve external entities within the DTD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prevention\n",
    "The safest way to prevent XXE is always to disable DTDs (external entities) completely. Depending on the parser, the method should be similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "factory.setFeature(\"http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\", true);\n",
    "\n",
    "Disabling DTDs also secures the parser against denial of service (DoS) attacks. If DTDs can’t be disabled completely, then external entities and external doctypes must be disabled in the way that’s specific to each parser."

    "- In an XSS attack, a hacker takes advantage of expanded functionality to exploit other users and the underlying system.\n",
    "- Malicious users access the code and insert unauthorized JavaScript, VBScript, HTML, or other active content into a web page. When an unsuspecting user accesses that page, the malicious code executes an attack on the user’s browser. Attacks can include hijacking the user’s session, submitting unauthorized transactions as that user, stealing confidential information, or vandalizing the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types\n",
    "- **Stored XSS** - malicious input is permanently stored on a server, and return to a browser. For example - a message board post or data in a user profile.\n",
    "- **Reflected XSS** - occurs when malicious input is sent to a server and reflected back to the user on the response page. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a link that has the malicious input in it, like: `https://vulnerablesite.com?param=<script>document.cookie()</script>`\n",
    "- **DOM-based XSS** - occurs when an attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM in the user’s browser. The web page isn’t changed, but its client-side code executes in a malicious way because of these DOM changes. Server/DB is not involved. Many security products can’t catch this kind of attack if the malicious input doesn’t reach the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mitigation\n",
    "Since XSS is caused by weak separation between code context and user data, to defend against it, you have to strengthen the barrier between these two components. Two basic techniques are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Filtering**  Whitelisting is the most secure, since the developer only needs to know expected input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Encoding**  prevents malicious payloads in the system from executing. Because output encoding doesn’t rely on upstream or downstream protections, it can’t be bypassed by alternative input pathways. In output encoding, a server takes all characters that are meaningful in a specific context (HTML, JavaScript, URL) and replaces them with a text version."
